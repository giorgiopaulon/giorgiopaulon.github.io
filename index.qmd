:::{#about-heading}

Hey there! I'm Giorgio Paulon, Statistical Scientist at [Berry Consultants](https://www.berryconsultants.com/).

In my work, I design and analyze innovative and adaptive, often Bayesian, clinical trials. I'm passionate about communicating complex statistical ideas to broad audiences and I love creating efficient workflows that enhance the inferential reproducibility of clinical research.


I'm originally from <a style="color:rgb(205,38,38);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udine">Udine</a>, Italy, and I now live in Austin, TX.
Before completing my PhD in Statistics at the University of Texas at Austin, I studied Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano and at Ã‰cole Centrale Paris, in the context of a double degree program (<a style="color:rgb(205,38,38);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Industrial_Managers_for_Europe">T.I.M.E</a>).
<br>
<br>
Outside of work, I love photography, and I am passionate about traveling. 
**Photography** is a mental exercise that helps me to focus and unwind. 
**Traveling** keeps me motivated and gives me new perspectives outside of my everyday routine.
