I am Giorgio Paulon, Statistical Scientist at [Berry Consultants](https://www.berryconsultants.com/) where I work on designing and analyzing innovative and adaptive clinical trials. 
I completed my PhD in Statistics at The University of Texas at Austin under the joint supervision of [Abhra Sarkar](https://abhrastat.github.io) and [Peter Müller](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/pmueller/).

I am originally from <a style="color:rgb(205,38,38);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udine">Udine</a>, Italy, and I obtained both my BSc and MSc at Politecnico di Milano in Mathematical Engineering. 
I also spent two years at École Centrale Paris, France, for a double degree program (<a style="color:rgb(205,38,38);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Industrial_Managers_for_Europe">T.I.M.E</a>).
<br>
I love photography and I am passionate about travelling.
**Photography** is a mental exercise that helps me to focus and to relax. 
**Travelling** gives me many motivations and helps me finding the unexpected outside of my daily routine.
