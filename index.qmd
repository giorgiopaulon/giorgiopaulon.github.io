:::{#about-heading}

Hey there! I’m Giorgio Paulon, a Statistical Scientist at [Berry Consultants](https://www.berryconsultants.com/).

I design and analyze innovative - often Bayesian - and adaptive clinical trials. I’ve worked on everything from simulation-based design to communicating interim results to DSMBs. I care deeply about reproducibility and transparency in clinical research, and I love building clean workflows that help teams make better decisions with data.

I’m originally from <a style="color:rgb(205,38,38);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udine">Udine</a>, Italy, and now live in Austin, TX. I completed my PhD in Statistics at the University of Texas at Austin, where I worked on Bayesian clustering methods for longitudinal data and collaborated on neuroscience experiments. Before that, I studied Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano and École Centrale Paris through a double degree program (<a style="color:rgb(205,38,38);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Industrial_Managers_for_Europe">T.I.M.E</a>).

Outside of work, I’m into photography and travel. **Photography** helps me slow down and pay attention to detail; **travel** keeps me inspired and curious - both are ways I stay connected to the world beyond the screen.
