I’m Giorgio Paulon, Statistical Scientist at Berry Consultants.\nIn my work, I design and analyze innovative and adaptive, often Bayesian, clinical trials. I’m passionate about communicating complex statistical ideas to broad audiences and I love creating efficient workflows that enhance the inferential reproducibility of clinical research.\nI’m originally from Udine, Italy, and I now live in Austin, TX. Before completing my PhD in Statistics at the University of Texas at Austin, I studied Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano and at École Centrale Paris, in the context of a double degree program (T.I.M.E).   Outside of work, I love photography, and I am passionate about traveling. Photography is a mental exercise that helps me to focus and unwind. Traveling keeps me motivated and gives me new perspectives outside of my everyday routine."

    "text": "Teaching\nDuring my time as a PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, I designed and taught the course “Statistical Learning and Inference” to a class of about 50 upper-level undergraduate students twice (Fall 2019 and Fall 2020). The course introduced students to ideas of statistical learning and predictive modeling from a statistical, theoretical and computational perspective. All course materials are publicly available here."
