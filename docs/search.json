I completed my PhD in Statistics at The University of Texas at Austin under the joint supervision of Abhra Sarkar and Peter Müller.\n\n\n\nI am originally from Udine, Italy, and I obtained both my BSc and MSc at Politecnico di Milano in Mathematical Engineering. I also spent two years at École Centrale Paris, France, for a double degree program (T.I.M.E).   I love photography and I am passionate about travelling. Photography is a mental exercise that helps me to focus and to relax. Travelling gives me many motivations and helps me finding the unexpected outside of my daily routine.\n\n\n\n\n\nUdine, Italy"
